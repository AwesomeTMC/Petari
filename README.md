# Petari
A decompilation of Super Mario Galaxy 1. The end goal is to be as close to 1:1 to the original code as possible.

# Compiling
Ensure you have CodeWarrior in your $PATH enviornment. After you have it, just run the python script:

```
python build.py
```

If you do not have CodeWarrior in $PATH, stick the executables into a folder on the root named "tools".

If it successfully builds, all of the binaries are located in the "build" folder.
