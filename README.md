# Super Mario Galaxy 1 Decompilation

This repo contains a WIP decompilation of Super Mario Galaxy 1 (USA).

## Build Instructions

1. Obtain a copy of mwcceppc and mwldeppc from CodeWarrior 1.2.5 for Gamecube (I can supply this if you DM me shibboleet#1010). You can run the installer and grab the two files out of the `PowerPC_EABI_Tools/Command_Line_Tools` folder where you installed it. Also obtain `powerpc-eabi-as` and `powerpc-eabi-objcopy`, which can be installed with [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started). These will go into the `tools` folder.
2. Run `build.py`.
